## Data Platform Benefits Brainstorming

* Do not reinvent the bicycle!

* Do not repeat yourself - use a data platform!

* Data Platform is the foundational framework which data intensive applications built on - well designed platform results in better solution quality.

* Data Platform (Foundation) defines services and architectural blueprints necessary to approach common business problem scenarios thus making sure data solutions are feasible, cost effective and could grow to extend the solution.

* Data Platform is like Lego blocks design - a set of blocks (services) which fit and collaborate so that they could be used to build virtually everything.

* Using reusable processing components, packaged in a data platform enables end-to-end platform governance and data stewardship.

* The data platform takes care about the - scalability, security, performance, maintainability, portability and other -ilities of the IT solution. 

* Data platform brings standardization across the solutions, reduces the number and variety of the technologies and implements reusable components. This results in simple, easier and faster to implement and maintain solutions, requiring less engineering effort and skills.

* Data platform enables serverless, Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) architecture approach for any data intensive IT solution - in the cloud, hybrid or on-premise.

* To enable engineering of flexible and agile data intensive IT solution and at the same time, in parallel, the implementation of the underlying framework services and infrastructure, a Data Platform abstraction is used.

* Data platform defines interface between the IT solution and vendor specific data management application, utilities and frameworks, thus reducing the coupling and dependency on the specific vendors versions which in turn improves maintainability and upgradeability of solutions across the enterprise.

* Data solution without platform is like a building without architecture. Enterprise without data platform is like city without urban design.

* The Data Platform lays the architectural foundation for IT solutions. Are you so rich to afford yourself building a solution without an architecture?

## === Work in Ideation ====

## Who Should be Interested?

Data Platform is not a business solution, it is an IT solution which provides capabilities as services to other IT solutions.

## When Should I Bother About Having a Data Platform?

If you ... (intention, need) ... than you ... (solution approach)...
