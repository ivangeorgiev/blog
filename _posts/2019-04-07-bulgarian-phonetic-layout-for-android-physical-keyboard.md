One solution is to install separate Phonetic Keyboard Layout. 

1. Download the `.apk` from [marfl/android-bulgarian-phonetic-layout](marfl/android-bulgarian-phonetic-layout) GitHub project.
2. Open the `.apk` on your device (phone, tablet, etc)
3. Enable install from unknown sources
4. Install the `.apk`
5. Disable "Install unknown apps" (optional - highly recommended)
   1. Open Settings
   2. Search for "install unknown apps"
   3. Open the "Install Unknown Apps" settings
   4. Find all apps with setting `Allowed` and switch to `Not allowed`
6. Add `Bulgarian Phonetic` as separate input language
